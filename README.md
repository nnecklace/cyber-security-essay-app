# cyber-security-essay-app

Application is a super simple (poorly made) todo application.
Application is based on cyber security base application. Repo [here](https://github.com/cybersecuritybase/cybersecuritybase-project).

## Notes

Java 8 or higher is required to run the app. The app uses an in-memory database. Any changes to the app while it's running will empty the database and result in some interesting bugs.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
mvn install
```

Run the application:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
